I work as a data wrangler at the <a href="https://isr.umich.edu/" class="highlight blue"><b>Institute for Social Resarch</b></a> at the <a href="https://umich.edu/" class="highlight blue"><b>University of Michigan</b></a>, within the <a href="https://src.isr.umich.edu/" class="highlight blue"><b>Survey Research Center</b></a>. I help create reports and manage data for the <a href="https://isr.umich.edu/" class="highlight blue"><b>Monitoring the Future Study</b></a>. 

In graduate school, I <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0013916520952452?journalCode=eaba" class="highlight green"><b>designed a study and wrote a paper</b></a> about mindfulness, connection to nature, and pro-environmental behavior. I also helped <a href="https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/28216/chapter-abstract/213234231?redirectedFrom=fulltext" class="highlight green"><b>analyze parent-adolescent conversations</b></a> about volunteering. My thesis focused on how urbanicity influenced civic engagement in american youth.

I also volunteer for <a href="https://www.wbwc.org/" class="highlight orange"><b>Walk Bike Washtenaw</b></a> an organization advocating for safer and more comfortable transportation infrastructure for people in and around Ann Arbor, MI. Currently, I am the only author of this blog, but I hope in the future that changes. Feel free to reach out.
