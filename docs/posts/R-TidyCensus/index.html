<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>As you may already know I am a big fan of <a href="https://thegilpatrick.com/blog/helloObservable.html">ObservableJS</a>. I use it to create dashboards at work and for fun side projects like this <a href="https://thegilpatrick.com">blog</a>. I think a big advantage to ObservableJS is that it is an extension of JavaScript with a reactive runtime. JavaScript is the language of interactivity on the web. All of it can be run from your browser, you don’t even need a server like you do for <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a>.</p>
<p>Sure there are R packages that create interactive graphs and maps, but for the most part they are built on top of JavaScript. There are also limitations to the browser’s engine, you have to be wise with the amount of data you are using (or be wise about how you use it). But the degree to which you can customize your visualizations without knowing too much about web development is pretty unparalleled. Sure you could learn a JavaScript framework like <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> or <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> and spend hours learning all of the related languages of the web.</p>
<p>But I find that ObservableJS allows you to live at the sweet spot of knowing just enough to do whatever you envision without being a full blown full stack web developer. <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot">Observable Plot</a> just came out with some new mapping capabilities. There is a great <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/build-your-first-map-with-observable-plot">tutorial</a> on how to use these new features of Plot. But today I am going to show you how you can pair ObservableJS with the R tidycensus package using Quarto.</p>

<section id="tidycensus-examples" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tidycensus-examples">TidyCensus examples</h2>
<p>The tidycensus package is a nice and tidy way to interact with the Census API. <a href="https://walker-data.com/about.html">Kyle Walker</a> created the tidycensus R package and has a free book called <a href="https://walker-data.com/census-r/">Analyzing US Census Data</a> that covers the package extensively. I highly recommend perusing it if this is the first time you have heard of the tidycensus package. Below are two examples straight from his book.</p>
<p>When you first use tidycensus you will want to run the <code>census_api_key()</code> function. You can get a <a href="https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html">free API key from the Census</a>. The second argument allows R to save your API key for future R sessions. So you don’t have to use this function everytime you use tidycensus. I wont go over the R code line by line but I commented in what each chunk is doing. Quarto enables us to use R for wrangling and pass the data into Observable.</p>

<p>ObservableJS has a bunch of inputs built in. <code>Inputs.table()</code> is an easy way to see your data in a table. It isn’t an input in this example because it isn’t connected to anything. It is just a table to see our data columns and rows visually. But if you hover on the left side of the table you can select certain rows. This could be used as an <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/inputs">input</a> to filter rows in a dataset. You can also sort the rows in either ascending or descending order if you click on the column header.</p>

<p>My only complaint (and it is a small one) is that you need to transpose the data when it is passed into an ObservableJS environment from R. Which either means you always have to put your data name in a <code>transpose()</code> function or have another step to name your dataset so it looks prettier. But renaming your data all the time gets old fast. So I tend to just transpose inline.</p>

<p>Below I recreated Kyle’s <a href="https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html">basic ggplot2 example</a> for comparison’s sake. Except I added a tooltip that enlarges the circle and shows the median age when you hover over it. This is obviously achievable in many R interactive graphing packages.</p>

<p>It looks like in 2010 younger folks were not moving (and/or staying) to the northeast as much as they were to states like California, Texas, and Georgia. I think the Mormon influence of big families (lots of kids) probably explains younger median age in Utah and Florida’s reputation as a warm place to retire probably plays a role here as well.</p>

<p>When you hit submit you can see the name populate as a string. The <code>viewof</code> option allows you to just type your named input again to see the results. I am filtering the data based on that <code>search</code> variable I just made. I set them to lower case to not have an error due to punctuation. But multiple states have the same county name. <code>Lincoln</code>, <code>Washington</code>, or any president’s last name for example are popular county names in multiple states. To ensure we get the county from the right state I added simple radio button that will populate based on the <code>filteredData</code> we just created with the <code>search</code> input.</p>

<p>Now I can see my <code>radio</code> object that is returned. I can use that data even in my markdown in Quarto. So for example this <code>${radio[0].NAME}</code> Gives me this: <span><span id="ojs-element-id-1"></span>.</span> Which is controlled by both the search bar and the radio buttons above. So go ahead and search another name or click on a different state button and check back here. Median income in <span><span id="ojs-element-id-2"></span></span> is <span>$<span id="ojs-element-id-4"></span></span> and the median age is <span><span id="ojs-element-id-3"></span></span> years old.</p>

<p>Because this is a topojson file now it would be pointless to view it in a table, because there are nested variables within. Instead Observable has a built in way of viewing JSON. all you need to do is type the name of your JSON dataset. Which I have been doing to show you results of inputs but it is also helpful for looking at nested data.</p>

<p>Below is the Observable Plot’s new geo mark enabling a lot of D3 mapping capabilities in the same readable and easy to understand code format as Plot. I put in a dropdown menu to choose from different county names. Some are very common like <code>Lewis</code>, or <code>Pike</code> but some are original like <code>Washtenaw</code> or <code>Kern</code>. Because I am matching just the county name and not the the state it shows all counties that have that name in the US. Give it a try. If you hover over a county with your mouse it will show you a tooltip as well.</p>

<p>Well I planned out a bunch of other stuff to try, but I guess I should stop here before this gets too long. In the future I will play around with the combination of R and Observable. I would like to do some more mapping, some more complex interactions, and some other APIs. Thanks for reading and you have any questions or spotted something funky in my code that could be better let me know!</p>

<span id="cb35-18"><a href="#cb35-18" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>As you may already know I am a big fan of <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">ObservableJS</span><span class="co">](https://thegilpatrick.com/blog/helloObservable.html)</span>. I use it to create dashboards at work and for fun side projects like this <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">blog</span><span class="co">](https://thegilpatrick.com)</span>. I think a big advantage to ObservableJS is that it is an extension of JavaScript with a reactive runtime. JavaScript is the language of interactivity on the web. All of it can be run from your browser, you don't even need a server like you do for <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Shiny</span><span class="co">](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)</span>. </span>
<span id="cb35-19"><a href="#cb35-19" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb35-20"><a href="#cb35-20" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Sure there are R packages that create interactive graphs and maps, but for the most part they are built on top of JavaScript. There are also limitations to the browser's engine, you have to be wise with the amount of data you are using (or be wise about how you use it). But the degree to which you can customize your visualizations without knowing too much about web development is pretty unparalleled. Sure you could learn a JavaScript framework like <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">React</span><span class="co">](https://reactjs.org/)</span> or <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Svelte</span><span class="co">](https://svelte.dev/)</span> and spend hours learning all of the related languages of the web. </span>
<span id="cb35-21"><a href="#cb35-21" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb35-22"><a href="#cb35-22" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>But I find that ObservableJS allows you to live at the sweet spot of knowing just enough to do whatever you envision without being a full blown full stack web developer. <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Observable Plot</span><span class="co">](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot)</span> just came out with some new mapping capabilities. There is a great <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">tutorial</span><span class="co">](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/build-your-first-map-with-observable-plot)</span> on how to use these new features of Plot. But today I am going to show you how you can pair ObservableJS with the R tidycensus package using Quarto.</span>
<span id="cb35-23"><a href="#cb35-23" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb35-24"><a href="#cb35-24" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">## TidyCensus examples</span></span>
<span id="cb35-25"><a href="#cb35-25" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb35-26"><a href="#cb35-26" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The tidycensus package is a nice and tidy way to interact with the Census API. <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Kyle Walker</span><span class="co">](https://walker-data.com/about.html)</span> created the tidycensus R package and has a free book called <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Analyzing US Census Data</span><span class="co">](https://walker-data.com/census-r/)</span> that covers the package extensively. I highly recommend perusing it if this is the first time you have heard of the tidycensus package. Below are two examples straight from his book. </span>
<span id="cb35-27"><a href="#cb35-27" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb35-28"><a href="#cb35-28" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>When you first use tidycensus you will want to run the <span class="in">`census_api_key()`</span> function. You can get a <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">free API key from the Census</span><span class="co">](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html)</span>. The second argument allows R to save your API key for future R sessions. So you don't have to use this function everytime you use tidycensus. I wont go over the R code line by line but I commented in what each chunk is doing. Quarto enables us to use R for wrangling and pass the data into Observable. </span>

It isn't an input in this example because it isn't connected to anything. It is just a table to see our data columns and rows visually. But if you hover on the left side of the table you can select certain rows. This could be used as an <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">input</span><span class="co">](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/inputs)</span> to filter rows in a dataset. You can also sort the rows in either ascending or descending order if you click on the column header.</span>

<span id="cb35-59"><a href="#cb35-59" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>My only complaint (and it is a small one) is that you need to transpose the data when it is passed into an ObservableJS environment from R. Which either means you always have to put your data name in a <span class="in">`transpose()`</span> function or have another step to name your dataset so it looks prettier. But renaming your data all the time gets old fast. So I tend to just transpose inline.</span>
